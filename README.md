# Finding_the_best_markets_to_advertise_in

The goal of this project is to find out the two best markets to advertise our product in

We are working for an e-learning company that offers courses on programming. Most of the courses are on web and mobile development but we also cover other domains like data science, game development etc. We want to promote our product by investing money in advertisement. 

For more returns on investment, we want to find out the two best markets to advertise our product in. 

### Data gathering
we found that data from freeCodeCamp's 2017 New coder survey ideal for the purpose of our analysis. The survey data is publicly available in [this](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey) GitHub repository 

### Data Analysis
Before starting to analyze the sample data we have, we need to clarify whether it's representative for our population of interest and it has the right categories of people for our purpose. 

Then we figure out what are the best markets to invest money in for advertising our courses by answering the questions:

- Where are these new coders located.
- What are the locations with the greatest number of new coders.
- How much money new coders are willing to spend on learning.
